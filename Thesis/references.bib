abstract = {We demonstrate continuous tuning of the squeezing level generated in a double-ring optical parametric oscillator by externally controlling the coupling condition using electrically controlled integrated microheaters. We accomplish this by utilizing the avoided crossing exhibited by a pair of coupled silicon nitride microring resonators. We directly detect a change in the squeezing level from 0.5 dB in the undercoupled regime to 2 dB in the overcoupled regime, which corresponds to a change in the generated on-chip squeezing factor from 0.9 dB to 3.9 dB. Such wide tunability in the squeezing level can be harnessed for on-chip quantum enhanced sensing protocols which require an optimal degree of squeezing.},

@article{Foster2006,
abstract = {Developing an optical amplifier on silicon is essential for the success of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonic integrated circuits. Recently, optical gain with a 1-nm bandwidth was demonstrated using the Raman effect, which led to the demonstration of a Raman oscillator, lossless optical modulation and optically tunable slow light. A key strength of optical communications is the parallelism of information transfer and processing onto multiple wavelength channels. However, the relatively narrow Raman gain bandwidth only allows for amplification or generation of a single wavelength channel. If broad gain bandwidths were to be demonstrated on silicon, then an array of wavelength channels could be generated and processed, representing a critical advance for densely integrated photonic circuits. Here we demonstrate net on/off gain over a wavelength range of 28 nm through the optical process of phase-matched four-wave mixing in suitably designed SOI channel waveguides. We also demonstrate wavelength conversion in the range 1,511-1,591 nm with peak conversion efficiencies of +5.2 dB, which represents more than 20 times improvement on previous four-wave-mixing efficiencies in SOI waveguides. These advances allow for the implementation of dense wavelength division multiplexing in an all-silicon photonic integrated circuit. Additionally, all-optical delays, all-optical switches, optical signal regenerators and optical sources for quantum information technology, all demonstrated using four-wave mixing in silica fibres, can now be transferred to the SOI platform.},

abstract = {Silicon photonics enables the fabrication of on-chip, ultrahigh- bandwidth optical networks that are critical for the future of microelectronics1–3. Several optical components necessary for implementing a wavelength division multiplexing network have been demonstrated in silicon. However, a fully integrated multiple-wavelength source capable of driving such a network has not yet been realized. Optical amplification, a necessary component for lasing, has been achieved on-chip through stimulated Raman scattering4,5, parametric mixing6 and by silicon nanocrystals7 or nanopatterned silicon8. Losses in most of these structures have prevented oscillation. Raman oscillators have been demonstrated9–11, but with a narrow gain bandwidth that is insufficient for wavelength division multiplexing. Here, we demonstrate the first monolithically integrated CMOS-compatible source by creating an optical parametric oscillator formed by a silicon nitride ring resonator on silicon. The device can generate more than 100 new wave- lengths with operating powers below 50mW. This source can form the backbone of a high-bandwidth optical network on a microelectronic chip.},

In view of its real-world applications, the realization of easy-to-operate experimental systems compatible with existing fiber networks is a crucial step. To comply with these requirements, we demonstrate the feasibility of a squeezing experiment at a telecom wavelength realized, for the first time, in an entirely guided-wave fashion. In our work, the state generation relies on waveguide nonlinear optics technology while squeezing collection and transmission are implemented by using only telecom fiber components. By doing so, we observe up to \&\#x2212;1.83\&\#x00B1;0.05\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;dB of squeezing emitted at 1542 nm in the CW pumping regime. The compactness and stability of the experiment, compared to free-space configurations, represent a significant advance towards achieving out-of-the-lab continuous variable quantum communications that are fully compatible with long-distance operations in telecom fibers. We believe that this work stands as a promising approach for real applications as well as for \&\#x201C;do-it-yourself\&\#x201D; experiments.},

Here, we present systematical investigation and optimization of the second-harmonic generation in a dual-resonant aluminum nitride microring resonator.

To the best of our knowledge, this is a state-of-the-art value among all the integrated photonic platforms. We also study the high-power regime where the pump power depletion is non-negligible. A conversion efficiency of 12\% is realized with 27 mW pump power. Our high-efficiency second-harmonic generator enables integrated frequency conversion and frequency locking between visible and infrared systems, and our approach can also apply to other photonic platforms.},
